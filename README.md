BDD Webdriver Steps
===================
This project aims to help testing web applications by defining common
[Gherkin](http://docs.behat.org/en/v2.5/guides/1.gherkin.html) steps oriented
to web development.

The goal is to provide steps that are compatible with 
[Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/) and
[Aloe](https://aloe.readthedocs.io/) using Selenium Webdriver to interact with
web browsers.

Steps related with Django are also provided.
